# taurAI

**taurAI** is a grassroots Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on curating, processing, and modeling **low-resource African languages**, starting with **Shona** and **Ndebele**.

## 🌍 Why taurAI?

Many African languages remain underrepresented in AI. TaurAI aims to:
- Build quality sentiment datasets in Shona and Ndebele
- Train and evaluate machine learning and transformer-based models
- Enable local NLP tools for education, agriculture, healthcare, and governance
- Promote open collaboration among African AI researchers

## 📊 Datasets
Language	# Samples	Sentiments
Shona	~150+	Positive, Negative, Neutral
Ndebele	~150+	Positive, Negative, Neutral

We’re still growing! Contributions welcome.

 ## Goals
 Curate initial sentiment datasets

 Train first classifier (logistic regression, then transformers)

 Expand into part-of-speech tagging, translation, and speech

 Deploy demo with Gradio or Streamlit
